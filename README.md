# Congratulations on Completing Phase 5!

You've done it! You've completed the fifth and final phase of Flatiron School's
Software Engineering Program! If you're like most Flatiron students, it's been a
long journey: sometimes difficult, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately
rewarding.

Take a moment to acknowledge all you've accomplished:

- You've learned frontend programming using JavaScript, the most widely-used and
  in-demand programming language.
- You've learned how to use Python to solve problems and automate complex tasks.
- You know how to streamline and increase the efficiency of your applications
  using two popular web frameworks: React and Flask.
- You've created a solid portfolio of projects that demonstrate your skills.
- Most importantly, you've _learned how to learn_, putting you in a great
  position expand your programming skillset to include other languages and
  frameworks.

Congratulations again â€” you can now officially call yourself a full-stack developer!
